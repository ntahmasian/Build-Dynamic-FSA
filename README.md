# Build-Dynamic-FSA

this assignment is to implement the dynamic finite state automaton
that recognizes none initially, but some after reading files Input1 and Input2.

Use a transition list that links transitions out of each state together. 
This approach saves space, and also makes the concept of state implicit since instead of finding
the next state for a given symbol, you will find the first transition out of that state.
